# Chess Vision

**Real-time chess move assistant that watches your screen, detects the board, recognizes pieces, and highlights the best move using Stockfish.**

Built for chess.com — works as a transparent overlay on macOS that stays on top of everything and lets clicks pass through.

## How It Works

```
Screen Capture  →  Board Detection  →  Piece Recognition  →  Stockfish Analysis  →  Overlay
    (mss)           (OpenCV HSV)       (Template Match)       (depth 12)          (PyQt6)
```

1. **Captures** your screen every 500ms
2. **Detects** the chess.com board by matching green/beige square colors in HSV space
3. **Recognizes** all pieces using template matching (light + dark square variants)
4. **Detects your color** automatically — your pieces are always on the bottom
5. **Analyzes** the position with Stockfish and finds the best move
6. **Highlights** the move on a transparent overlay pinned above all windows

The overlay is click-through — you interact with chess.com normally underneath it.

| Move Suggestion | Status Banner |
|---|---|
| Red square = piece to move | Green banner = your turn |
| Green square = destination | Blue banner = opponent's turn |

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses native Cocoa APIs for the overlay)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Stockfish** engine installed

## Installation

### 1. Install Stockfish

```bash
brew install stockfish
```

### 2. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kryskata-C/chessbot.git
cd chessbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Grant screen recording permission

Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** and enable your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, etc).

## Usage

### First time — Calibrate

Open chess.com in your browser with a game at the **starting position** (standard green/beige theme), then run:

```bash
python calibrate.py
```

This extracts piece templates from the visible board. Templates are saved to `templates/` and only need to be captured once per display/theme.

> **Tip:** If you skip this step, the app will try to auto-calibrate when it first sees a starting position.

### Run the assistant

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see a status banner at the top of your screen:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **"Playing as White"** | Detected your color |
| **"Best move: e2e4"** | Your turn — move highlighted |
| **"Opponent's turn"** | Waiting for opponent |
| **"Scanning... no board found"** | No chess.com board visible |

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit (in terminal) |

```

## Configuration

Edit the constants at the top of `main.py`:

```python
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS = 500   # How often to scan (ms)
```

Edit `engine.py` constructor for Stockfish settings:

```python
ChessEngine(depth=12, threads=2)  # depth 12 ≈ 2800+ ELO, responds in ms
```

| Depth | Approx. ELO | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | ~2200 | Instant |
| 12 | ~2800 | ~50ms |
| 18 | ~3200 | ~2-5s |
| 22 | ~3400 | ~30s+ |

## How the Overlay Works

The overlay uses native macOS Cocoa APIs via `ctypes` to:

- **Pin above all windows** — `NSScreenSaverWindowLevel` (level 1000)
- **Pass through all clicks** — `setIgnoresMouseEvents:YES`
- **Show on all desktops** — `setCollectionBehavior` with `canJoinAllSpaces`

No focus stealing, no cursor grabbing — completely invisible to interaction.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No board found"**
- Make sure the chess.com board is fully visible on your primary monitor
- Use the default green/beige theme (the detector looks for those specific colors)
- Check that screen recording permission is granted

**Poor piece recognition**
- Re-run `python calibrate.py` with the starting position visible
- Make sure no popups or overlays are covering the board during calibration
- Each template needs both light and dark square variants — `recalibrate.py` handles this

**Wrong color detected**
- The app detects your color once on first scan based on which pieces are on the bottom
- Restart the app if you switch colors between games
